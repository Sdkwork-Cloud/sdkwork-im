# Deployment

This section covers deployment and operational entry points implemented in the repository today.

## Deployment Modes

| Mode | Entry points | Best use |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Development stack | `pnpm im:dev`, `pnpm im:dev:unified`, `pnpm server:dev` | Local development, PC integration, smoke |
| Packaged server | `bin/install-server.*`, `bin/start-server.*`, `bin/verify-server.*` | Production-style installs and service management |
| Standalone control plane | `cargo run -p governance-service --offline` | Governance API development |

## How To Choose A Path

### For development and debugging

Use [Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start) and [Local Binary](/deployment/local-binary):

- `pnpm im:dev` loads `self-hosted.split-services.development`
- application ingress defaults to `http://127.0.0.1:18079`

### For production-style installs

Use [Server Lifecycle](/deployment/server-lifecycle):

- `sdkwork-im-server` single-port contract
- PostgreSQL-backed config roots and service-manager wrappers

## Profile Authority

Topology profile ids live in `specs/topology.spec.json`. Retired legacy profile names must not be used.
